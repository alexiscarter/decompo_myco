#### This repository contains the R scripts and R data files to reproduce the analyses realized for an article looking at organic matter decomposition in a litterbag reciprocal transplant experiment at the Université de Montréal's field station (Station de Biologie des Laurentides) using permanent forest plots described in Carteron et al. "Temperate forests dominated by arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi are characterized by strong shifts from saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungi with increasing soil depth" In review (data available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3631861 and R scripts at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3631982).

Raw data for the analyses can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3743507 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3631861
